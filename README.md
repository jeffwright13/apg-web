## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Upload a phrase file and generate audio!

## What's New in v1.9.10

### Code Quality & Bug Fixes
- **Bug fix**: Background audio settings (`attenuation`, `fade-in`, `fade-out`) now correctly preserve zero values when saving projects (was coercing `0` to default via `||` instead of `??`)
- **Refactor**: Consolidated three near-identical TTS engine pipelines in `handleSubmit` into shared `buildTtsOptions()` and `generateAndFinalize()` methods — eliminates ~280 lines of duplicated code
- **Cleanup**: Removed dead `applySyntaxHighlighting()` and `generateLineNumbers()` methods and their associated CSS rules
- **Tests**: 315 passing tests (up from 161 at v1.0.0), covering all new and refactored logic

**Best for**: Users who want simple setup, predictable per-use costs, and excellent quality

### Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

**High quality, generous free tier, requires API key and billing setup**

- 💰 **Cost**: Free tier (1M characters/month), then $16/1M characters
- 🔑 **Setup Required**:
  1. Create [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  2. Enable Text-to-Speech API
  3. **Enable billing** (credit card required, even for free tier)
  4. Create API key

- ✅ **Features**: Advanced parameters (pitch, rate, volume), dynamic voice discovery
- ✅ **Export**: Full audio export and mixing support

**Billing Details**:
- Free tier: 1 million characters/month (WaveNet/Neural2)
- After free tier: $16 per 1 million characters
- Example: 6,600 generations of 150-char program = FREE

### Google Translate TTS (gTTS) - **Coming Soon**

**Requires backend proxy (CORS limitation)**

- ✅ **Cost**: Completely free
- ❌ **Status**: Not available in browser-only version
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Google Translate endpoint blocks browser requests (CORS)
- 🔧 **Solution**: Requires backend server or CORS proxy

**Note**: This worked in the Python version because it ran server-side. Browser version needs a proxy server to bypass CORS restrictions.

### Web Speech API - **Browser Playback Only**

**Free, no setup, limited functionality**

- ✅ **Cost**: Free
- ✅ **Setup**: None
- ⚠️ **Quality**: Browser-dependent (Chrome: good, Firefox/Safari: poor)

### Troubleshooting

#### "Invalid API key" error
- Make sure you copied the entire API key
- Check that you enabled the Text-to-Speech API
- Verify the API key restrictions (if set) include Text-to-Speech API

#### "Billing not enabled" error
- Billing must be enabled even for free tier usage
- Go to Billing section and link a payment method
- Wait a few minutes after enabling billing

#### "Quota exceeded" error
- You've exceeded the free tier (1M characters/month)
- Check your usage in Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Dashboard
- Either wait for the monthly reset or upgrade to paid tier

#### API key security
- Your API key is stored locally in your browser (localStorage)
- It's never sent to any server except Google's TTS API
- You can clear it anytime by clicking "Clear" in the browser
- For production use, consider restricting the API key to specific domains
