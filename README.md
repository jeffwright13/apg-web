### Troubleshooting

#### "Invalid API key" error
- Make sure you copied the entire API key
- Check that you enabled the Text-to-Speech API
- Verify the API key restrictions (if set) include Text-to-Speech API

#### "Billing not enabled" error
- Billing must be enabled even for free tier usage
- Go to Billing section and link a payment method
- Wait a few minutes after enabling billing

#### "Quota exceeded" error
- You've exceeded the free tier (1M characters/month)
- Check your usage in Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Dashboard

- It's never sent to any server except Google's TTS API
- You can clear it anytime by clicking "Clear" in the browser
- For production use, consider restricting the API key to specific domains
